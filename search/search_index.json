A user is authenticated before their authorization can be determined. To verify identity, a user can provide: Something you know - e.g. username/password (not very reliable) Something you have - e.g. token Something about you (something you are) e.g. biometrics \u2757 Requires extra hardware, lacks specificity New categories what users do (dynamic biometrics such as typing patterns, gait) where a user is (physical location) ATMs use combination of something you know (PIN) and something you have (card) so if the card is lost, someone cannot authenticate as you Authorization Applies predetermined access levels to the user Three elements are used Requestor (subject) - already known due to authentication system Object 1. file, program, data, other resource Type/level of access to be granted 1. Read, write, create, delete, right to grant access rights to other objects Accounting (Auditing) Accounting is a means of measuring activity, auditing is the verification of what actual happened and allows management to observe in a nonpartisan manner Accounting can be done in IT systems by logging crucial activity as it occurs Accounting is needed when activity of specific data elements is crucial enough that it may be audited at a later date and time Security level auditing can be performed at several levels: analysis of logging function verification of existence and operation of specific controls etc Auditing takes resources to create, store, and review. Typically defaulted to minimal level so system operator must determine correct level based on system criticality. System criticality is determined by information criticality associated with information manipulated/stored with the system Non-repudiation Preventing a subject from denying a previous action with an object When authentication, authorization, and auditing are properly configured, non-repudiation is ensured Security requirements must specify the subjects, objects, and events for which non-repudiation is desired System Tenets Session Management Design and implementation of controls to ensure that communication channels are secured from unauthorized access and disruption TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) sequential numbering of packets and retransmission for missing packets Prevents unauthorized packets and session hijacking Has overhead UDP (User Datagram Protocol) connection-less/session-less Exception Management All exceptions must be detected and handled System should not fail in an insecure state Exception should not be leaked Configuration Management Configuration should be protected from unauthorized changes e.g. separation of duties between production/non-prod personnel Secure Design Tenets Good Enough Security Don't spend $10,000 to protect a $20 bill Trade-offs exist between security and other aspects Least Privilege If a subject may require different levels of security for different tasks, better to switch security levels with specific tasks than run all the time at higher privilege Separation of Duties No single individual can abuse the system Defense in Depth i.e. layered security/defense and diversity defense Multiple, overlapping defenses No system is 100% secure - true goal of security is to make cost of compromising greater in time/effort/resources than it is worth Diversity of defense - layers should be dissimilar in nature Fail-safe When a system experiences a failure, it should fail to a safe state Example: explicit deny CIA need to be appropriately maintained - availability causes the greatest design difficulties Economy of Mechanism Higher complexity generally results in less security due to lack of understanding and more attack vectors Root cause analysis, especially for potential security issues, is much more difficult in complex systems Rule of thumb : eliminate all nonessential services and protocols Complete Mediation Authorization is never circumvented, even with repeated access Example: security kernel Open Design Don't rely on security by obscurity Example: modern cryptography relies on the secrecy of the key, not secrecy of the algorithm Least Common Mechanism Prevent inadvertent sharing of information by using separate processes when possible Psychological Acceptability Users will try to get around security if it is seen as an obstacle Weakest Link Adding to the security of a system is most effective when applied to the weakest link Leveraging Existing Components Pros: increase efficiency and security Cons: monoculture environment (failures have a larger footprint) Single Point of Failure No one single piece should be able to cause the whole system to fail Security Models Three key elements: people, processes, and technology Controls using 2-3 elements are more effective Access Control Models ACL - access control list MAC - mandatory access control rarely used originated in military restrict based on information sensitivity and clearance to access that information system designers have to determine object/subject relationships before they can be used DAC - discretionary access control most common originated in military restrict based on identity of subjects/groups they belong to If a subject has permission, it is capable of passing that permission onto any other subject ACLs are the most common mechanism used to implement this control Strength : simplicity Weakness : security is optional, owner has to define access for potentially a plethora of objects RBAC - role-based access control pretty common for active directory RBAC - rule-based access control much less common than role-based Use ACLs that have rules baked in such as only allow access during a certain time-of-day Access control matrix model strength: simplicity weakness: difficult to implement due to no constraints, doesn't scale well ABAC - attribute-based access control Example: doctor getting one set of access for a specific patient vs a different patient Represented via eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) also works for policy-based access control Bell-LaPadula Confidentiality Model Two principles Simple Security Rule - in order to see something, you have to be authorized 1. Used to preserve confidentiality - e.g. subject with medium clearance can't ready information with high sensitivity, only medium sensitivity 2. No-read-up * property (star property) 1. No-write-down 2. Subjects can only write to an object if the object has equal or higher classification - e.g. medium clearance can only write to medium sensitivity and above Take-Grant Model Uses graph theory based on mathematical representation of controls Can be used to definitively determine rights Not typically used to implement access control but rather to analyze implementations Multilevel Security Model Separate groups have labels, groups act as containers, can be hierarchical Integrity Models Depending on type of information, can be just as important or more important than confidentiality. e.g. stock prices (public but integrity is crucial) Biba Integrity Model Preserves information integrity Integrity levels separate permissions Low water mark policy, i.e. no-write-up rule lower integrity subjects can't write up to higher integrity subjects Integrity level of a subject is lowered if it acts on a subject with lower integrity Clark-Wilson security model Uses transactions Two levels: Constrained data items (CDI) Subject to integrity controls Unconstrained data items (UDI) Two types of processes: Integrity verification processes (IVPs) Ensure CDI data meets constraints Transformation processes (TPs) Change state of data from one to another Data can only be changed by trusted TPs, not users Example: A bank account balance is a CDI since integrity is important TP is the only way changes can be made IVP ensures balance is correct Information Flow Models Brewer-Nash Model (Chinese Wall) Technology employed to prevent access People trained not to compromise information Policies/processes put in place to ensure technology/people are properly used Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs) Main security issue is protecting information when stored, in transit, and being processed Multiple levels - Level 0 (high level), level 1, level 2 (lowest level) Use Case Model Functional perspective - how the system uses data Use cases for normal and abnormal use Very important to security to understand use cases and misuse cases Assurance Models Software assurance - level of confidence that software is free from intentional and accidental vulnerabilities, software functions as intended Operational model of security Three methods of managing security: prevention - access control, firewall, encryption detection - audit logs, intrusion detection, honeypots response - backups, incident response teams, forensics NIST CSF Standards, guidelines, best practices 5 main categories: Identify Protect Detect Respond Recover Adversaries Includes mother nature :) Adversary Type Based on skill level Script Kiddie - 80-85% of adversaries Hacker - explorer - 15-20% key adversary due to skill/motivation Cracker - hacker with malicious intent Elite - 1-3% completely underground Adversary Groups Skill and capability Unstructured threat - little or no resources, no specific motivation, typically only an annoyance Structured threat - specific mission, time and resources Highly structured threat - organized crime, crimeware Nation-state threat Advanced persistent threat (APT) - multiple methods to penetrate and then live undetected Insider vs outsider Threat Landscape Shift Around 2005 - criminalization of cyberspace allowing monetization Market for exploits","title":"General Security Concepts"},{"location":"01-Secure-Software-Concepts/01-General-Security-Concepts/#general-security-concepts","text":"","title":"General Security Concepts"},{"location":"01-Secure-Software-Concepts/01-General-Security-Concepts/#concepts","text":"","title":"Concepts"},{"location":"01-Secure-Software-Concepts/01-General-Security-Concepts/#security-basics","text":"\ud83d\udcdd Determining and applying the appropriate balance of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA) Although different, they are not necessarily contradictory - but they all require resources (money) and so the balance should be determined early on in the design process","title":"Security Basics"},{"location":"01-Secure-Software-Concepts/01-General-Security-Concepts/#confidentiality","text":"Prevent disclosure of information to unauthorized parties Numerous methods for keeping data confidential: e.g. access controls, encryption Access Controls : Preferred for data in use and at rest Encryption : Data at rest and in transit","title":"Confidentiality"},{"location":"01-Secure-Software-Concepts/01-General-Security-Concepts/#integrity","text":"Protect data from unauthorized alteration e.g. Read-only, Read-and-write, write-only, delete access, etc Integrity contributes to a system's stability and reliability as well as the authenticity of data","title":"Integrity"},{"location":"01-Secure-Software-Concepts/01-General-Security-Concepts/#availability","text":"Availability needed is determined by criticality of data and purpose in the overall system","title":"Availability"},{"location":"01-Secure-Software-Concepts/01-General-Security-Concepts/#authentication","text":"Determining the identity of a user.
